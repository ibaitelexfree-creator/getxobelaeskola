## 2026-02-20 - [Mobile Menu Accessibility]
**Learning:** Icon-only mobile menu toggles frequently lack ARIA labels and state indicators, making them inaccessible to screen reader users. Proper disclosure patterns using `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-hidden` are essential for a professional and accessible UI.
**Action:** Always audit mobile menu toggles for missing ARIA attributes and ensure they are linked to the menu container via ID.
